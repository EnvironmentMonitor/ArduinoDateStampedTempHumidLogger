The Following Items are required to allow the use of the Arduino Sketch....

Arduino      - ANY Arduino I suggest the Mini Pro as this offers better battery life.
               5V allows more voltage loss through the Sensor Cabling simplifying everything.


DHT22        - The sketch is set for Minimum of 2, but as many as you like just repeat the steps
               for the 2 Sensors addding the pin numbers for each additional Sensor (Plus 10K).
        
DS18B20      - These come in loads of forms but they all use the same data pin, at least 1 is Needed.
               This Sketch is set for 6 * DS18B20, data will be repeated for less Sensors, Add Print
               Statements for More.


SD Interface - There are a number of these ANY SPI Version TF or SD 2Gb or Larger
               Card Must have VALID Partition. ANY SD - Ethershield etc.
               

DS1307 RTC  - This requires the DS1307 module attached to the I2C pins A4 & A5
              the time must be set in the RTC.


Battery Pack - The Mini is Very Tolerant and any power brick with 6-12V
               or 6 * AA Batteries in a Holder Via RAW In.
